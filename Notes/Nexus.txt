========================================================
Source Code Repository Tools (or) Version Control Softwares
========================================================

-> Multiple developers will work for project development

-> Developers will be working from multiple locations

-> All developers code should be stored at one place (Code Integration Should Happen)##################
Sonatype Nexus
##################

-> Nexus is an Open Source Software & It is free

-> It is an Artifact Repository Server

-> It is used to store and retrieve build artifacts

-> Nexus software developed using Java 

Note: To install Nexus s/w we need to install java first

-> Currently people are using Nexus 3.x


Java : jar, war and ear

Docker : Docker images

Node JS : NPM package


Q) What is difference between Nexus and GitHub ?

-> Github is a SCM software which is used to store source code of the project

-> Nexus is Artifact Repository which is used to store build artifacts

##################
Nexus Setup
##################

-> Take t2.medium instance

-> Java s/w is required to install Nexus

-> Connect to t2.medium instance using mobaxterm


#  Nexus S/w Installation Process in Amazon Linux OS

$ sudo su -

$ cd /opt

# install java 1.8v 
$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk

Links to download : https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/product-information/download

# latest version
$ wget https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.40.1-01-unix.tar.gz

$ tar -zxvf nexus-3.40.1-01-unix.tar.gz

$ mv /opt/nexus-3.40.1-01 /opt/nexus


#As a good security practice, Nexus is not advised to run nexus service as a root user, so create a new user called nexus and grant sudo access to manage nexus services as follows.
 
$ useradd nexus

#Give the sudo access to nexus user

$ visudo
nexus ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

#Change the owner and group permissions to /opt/nexus and /opt/sonatype-work directories.

$ chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/nexus
$ chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/sonatype-work
$ chmod -R 775 /opt/nexus
$ chmod -R 775 /opt/sonatype-work

# Open /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc file and  uncomment run_as_user parameter and set as nexus user.

$ vi /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc
run_as_user="nexus"

# Create nexus as a service

$ ln -s /opt/nexus/bin/nexus /etc/init.d/nexus

# Switch as a nexus user and start the nexus service as follows.

$ su - nexus

# Enable the nexus services
$ sudo systemctl enable nexus

# Start the nexus service
$ sudo systemctl start nexus

#Access the Nexus server from Laptop/Desktop browser.
 
URL : http://IPAddess:8081/

Note: Enable this 8081 port number in Security Group

# Default Username
User Name: admin

# we can copy nexus password using below command
$ sudo cat /opt/sonatype-work/nexus3/admin.password


-> We can change nexus default properties 

	/opt/nexus/etc/nexus-default.properties


####################################
Integrate Maven with Nexus
####################################

-> Create Repositories in Nexus to store build artifacts

-> We will create 2 types of repositories in Nexus

	1) snapshot

	2) release

-> If project is under development then that project build artifacts will be stored into snapshot repository

-> If project development completed and released to production then that project build artifacts will be stored to release repository

Snanpshot Repo URL : http://65.0.92.87:8081/repository/ashokit-snapshot-repository/

Release Repo URL : http://65.0.92.87:8081/repository/ashokit-release-repository/

Note: Based on <version/> name available in project pom.xml file it will decide artifacts should be stored to which repository

-> Nexus Repository details we will configure in project pom.xml  file like below


  <distributionManagement>  
	<repository>
		<id>nexus</id>
		<name>Ashok IT Releases Nexus Repo</name>
		<url>http://43.205.146.33:8081/repository/ashokit-release-repository/</url>
	</repository>
	
	<snapshotRepository>
		<id>nexus</id>
		<name>Ashok IT Snapshots Nexus Repo</name>
		<url>http://43.205.146.33:8081/repository/ashokit-snapshot-repository/</url>
	</snapshotRepository>	
</distributionManagement>

-> Nexus Server Credentials will be configured in Maven "settings.xml" file

-> Maven Location : C:\apache-maven-3.8.5\conf

-> In settings.xml file, under <servers> tag add below <server> tag

	<server>
		<id>nexus</id>
		<username>admin</username>
		<password>admin</password>
	</server>


-> Once these details are configured then we can run below maven goal to upload build artifacts to Nexus Server

	$ mvn clean deploy


Note: When we execute maven deploy goal, internally it will execute 'compile + test + package + install + deploy' goals.

##################
Remote Repository 
##################

-> Remote repository used for shared libraries (common jars for projects)

-> If we want to use few jar files in multiple projects in the company then we will use Remote Repository 

-> Remote repository is specific to our company projects

-> Create remote repo in nexus and upload a jar file 

				-> Go to Repositories
				-> Create New Repository
				-> Choose Maven (Hosted) Repository
				-> Give a name for Repository (Ex: ashokit-remote-repository) & Complete the process
			
		Note: With above steps Remote Repository got created.

				-> Go to BrowseSection
				-> Select Remote Repository (By default it is empty)
				-> Click on Upload Component
				-> Upload Jar file and give groupId, artifactId and Version		

						groupId : in.ashokit
						artifactId : pwd-utils
						version : 1.0		
			

-> Take dependency details of uploaded jar file and add in project pom.xml as a dependency like below

<dependency>
  <groupId>in.ashokit</groupId>
  <artifactId>pwd-utils</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>

-> We need to add Remote Repository Details in pom.xml above <dependencies/> tag

		<repositories>
			<repository>
				<id>nexus</id>
				<url>http://43.205.146.33:8081/repository/ashokit-remote-repository/</url>
			</repository>
		</repositories>

-> After adding the remote repository details in pom.xml then execute maven package goal and see dependency is downloading from nexus repo or not.

		$ mvn clean package

-> We will create users and will give access for users for our repositories























Git Hub

BitBucket


=================================
Environment Setup to work with Git Hub
=================================

1) Create Github account ( www.github.com )

2) Download and install Git Client software ( https://git-scm.com/downloads )

3) Once installation completed, right click on the mouse and verify git options display (If git options displaying our git client installation completed successfully)


=====================
Working with GitHub
=====================

-> Login into github account with your credentials

-> Create Repository in github

Note: Repository is used to store project source code. Every Project will have one repository

-> When we create a repository, unique URL will be generated with Repository Name (i.e Repo URL)

		Ex: https://github.com/ashokitschool/hdfc_bank_app.git

-> All the developers will connect to repository using Repository URL

-> We can create 2 types of Repositories in Git Hub
	
			1) public repository 

			2) private repository

-> Public Repository means everybody can access but we can choose who can modify our repository

-> Private Repository means we will choose who can access and who can modify


		Repo URL : https://github.com/ashokitschool/01-devops-app.git


sudo yum install git

====================
Working with Git Bash
====================

-> Git Bash we can use as Git Client software to perform Git Operations

-> Download and install git client (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

-> Right Click on Mouse and choose "Open Git Bash Here"


git help : It will display frequently used git commands

git help <cmd-name> : It will open documentation for given command


==================================================
Configure Your Email and Name in GitBash with Commands
==================================================

$ git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"

$ git config --global user.name "name"

Note: email and name we will configure only for first time.


$ git init : To initialize our folder as git working tree folder

$ git clone : To clone git repository to our machine from github.com 

		Syntax : $ git clone <project-repo-url>

$ git status : It will display staged , un-staged and un-tracked files

		Syntax : $ git status

		Staged Files : The files which are added for commit

		Un-Staged Files : The files which are modified but not added for commit

		Un-tracked files : Newly created files

Note: To commit a file(s), we should add to staging area first


$ git add : It is used to add file(s) to staging area

		Syntax : $ git add <file-name>

				$ git add .


$ git commit : It is used to commit staged files to git local repository

		Syntax : $ git commit -m 'reason for commit'


$ git push : To push changes from git local repository to git central repository

		Syntax  : $ git push

$ git rm : To remove file(s) from repository


==================================================
Steps to push code to github central repository
==================================================

1) Create one public repository in git hub (take github repo url)

2) Clone github repository using 'git clone' command

		$ git clone 'repo-url'

3) Navigate to repository folder

4) Create one file in repository folder

		$ touch Demo.java

5) Check status of the file using 'git status' command

		$ git status (It will display as untracked file)

6) Add file to staging area using 'git add' command

		$ git add .

7) Commit file to git local repository

		$ git commit -m 'commit-msg'

8) Push file from git local repository to git central repository using 'git push' command

		$ git push

Note: If you are doing 'git push' for first time it will ask to enter your github account password.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Git bash will ask our password only for first time. It will save our git credentials in Credential Manager in Windows machine.

-> Go to Credential Manager -> Windows Credentials -> Select Github -> We can modify and delete saved credentials from here
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> When we do git commit then it will geneate a commit-id with 40 characters length

-> From this commit-id it will display first 7 characters in git hub central repository

-> We can check commit history using 'git log' command

==================================================
Steps to commit Maven Project to Github Repository
==================================================

1) Create Maven Project

2) Create GitHub Repository

Note: After creating git repository, it will display set of commands to execute

3) Open gitbash from project folder and execute below commands

$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'commit-msg'
$ git branch -M main
$ git remote add origin <repo-url>
$ git push -u origin master

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we are working on one task suddenly we may get some other priority task.

Usecase
++++++++
-> ager assigned task id : 101
-> I am working on that task (i am in middle of the task)
-> Managed told that stop the work for 101 and complete 102 on priority. 
-> Once 102 is completed then resume your work on 101

-> When manager asked me to start 102 task, i have already done few changes for 101 
  (partially completed)
  
-> We can't push partial changes to repository because with our partial changes existing functionality may break.

-> We can't delete our changes because we have spent few hours of time to implement those changes


***************  In this scenario we will go for 'git stash' option *********************

=> Git stash is used to save working tree changes to temporary location and make working tree clean.

-> After priority work completed we can get stashed changes back using 'gitstash apply'


============
Git Branches
============

-> Branches are used to maintain seperate code bases for our project

-> In GiT repository we can create multiple branches

main
develop
qa
release
research


-> development team will integrate the code in 'develop' branch

-> bug-fixing team will integrate the code in 'qa' branch

-> R & D team will integrate the code in 'research' branch


-> In github we can create branches

-> To clone particular branch in git repo we will use below command

		$ git clone -b <branch-name> <repo-url>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Git branch ?

Why we need git branches ?

How to create git branches ?

How to clone particular branch

How to switch from one branch to another branch

==============
Branch Merging
==============

=> The process of merging changes from one branch to another branch is called as Branch merging

=> We will use Pull Request for Branch Merging

============================
Steps to do branch merging
============================

1) Create feature branch from main branch

2) clone feature branch 

3) create new file in feature branch then commit and push to central repo

4) Go to central repository then create pull request to merge feature branch changes to main branch

Note: Once feature branch changes are merged to main branch then we can delete feature branch (if required)

================
What is .gitignore ?
================

-> This .gitignore is used to configure the files or folders which we want to ignore from our commits

-> The files and folders which are not required to commit to central repository those things we can configure in .gitignore file

Ex: In maven project, 'target' folder will be available which is not required to commit to central repository. This we can configure in .gitignore file.

---------------------------------------.gitignore-------------------------------------------------------

===================
git merge vs git rebase
===================

=> These commands are used to merge changes from one branch to another branch

-> git merge will maintain commit history

-> git rebase will not maintain that rebase history

-> When we are working on particular sprint and we want to merge changes from one branch to another branch then we will use 'git merge' command

-> Once sprint-1 is delivered then we want to take latest code of sprint-1 to start sprint-2 development. In this scenario we don't need commit history so we will use 'git rebase' command.

======================
What is git pull command 
======================

-> pull command is used to take latest changes from repository to local

-> When we want to make some changes to code, it is always recommended to take git pull


Note: When we execute 'git pull' there is a chance of getting conflicts. We need to resolve the conflict and we should push the code without conflicts.

push vs pull

clone vs pull

checkout vs pull
